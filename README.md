an ActivityPub-federated tumbleblog hosting platform

## some goals

this is just off the top of my head right now, I'll add more to this later:

- [ ] Full federation using ActivityPub and ActivityStreams
- [ ] A well-documented GraphQL API, enabling both web and mobile clients
- [ ] Theme support (using Handlebars as the templating engine)
- [ ] Support for additional user-created pages
