A federated tumbleblog hosting platform, designed so that users can take back ownership of their content.

Tumblepub is under active development and any GraphQL queries/mutations and configuration options are subject to change during this time.

## Goals

(this is just off the top of my head right now, I'll add more to this later)

- [ ] Full S2S federation using the ActivityPub protocol
- [ ] A well-documented GraphQL API, enabling both web and mobile clients
- [ ] Theme support (using Handlebars as the templating engine)
  - (I also want to be able to give accessibility feedback to themes somehow...)
- [ ] Support for additional user-created pages
